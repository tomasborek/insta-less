# Insta-less

A browser extension that modifies Instagram's web interface to reduce distractions. Currently for personal use only, compatible with Firefox based browsers.

If you want to try it out, you can clone the repo and run `bun run build` (or `npm run build`) to produce a `popup` directory, then load it as a temporary extension in your browser.
